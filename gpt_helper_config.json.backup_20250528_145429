It allows developers to clearly define their project goals, coding standards, technical specifications, and current tasks, thereby enhancing the precision and efficiency of AI-assisted coding.\n\nThe project is built in python and should utilize network resources to be able to handle both remote and local file systems assuming authentication has been previously configured for remote systems. \n\nRuntime Functionality:\n\nInteractive selection mechanism for developers to include or exclude specific files/directories for a session.\n\nAllow real-time editing and updating of contextual files (background.txt, rules.txt, current_goal.txt).\n\nGenerate and maintain session-specific context tailored for AI agent consumption.\n\nUser Interface (CLI/Web-based optional):\n\nClear, intuitive prompts to select and edit directories and files.\n\nReal-time feedback confirming user selections and edits.\n\nSimple interface for quick updating of goals and rules.\n\nTechnical Requirements:\n\nCompatibility across major operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS).\n\nLightweight and performant to avoid slowing development workflows.\n\nModular and extendable architecture to accommodate future integrations or additional functionalities.\n\nSecurity and Privacy:\n\nNo sensitive or proprietary data should be exposed unintentionally.\n\nOption for local storage and processing to ensure data privacy.\n\nDeliverables:\n\nFully documented and modular source code.\n\nComprehensive user guide and documentation for setup, configuration, and operation.\n\nInitial templates for background, rules, and current goal files.\n\nSuccess Criteria:\n\nSignificant reduction in the time developers spend preparing context for AI-assisted tasks.\n\nHigh accuracy and relevance in AI-generated code and solutions.\n\nPositive user feedback highlighting ease-of-use and effectiveness.",
    "rules": "- All files must include a comment in the first line that indicates the filepath and filename in the following example format: # gpt_helper/dev/setup/blacklist_setup.py\n- ChatGPT agents should always output code in chat and not use the Canvas feature.\n- Claude agents should always output code in the slideout artifact window.",
    "current_goal": "The current goal is to analyze our interface and attempt to improve the overall UX. We have made significant strides in the main application UX and user interface, but now we need to improve the setup process. Please analyze how the entire program works, and make strides to improve the setup in both interface, overall user experience, and features that may be easy to implement but are missing. We would like the users to have as much control as possible without overcomplicating the process.",
